        <p class="card-text">         
        
          I've always thought of writing cards for a birthday is kind of superficial in a way and not needed, but after experiencing the great friends that you have gained within your new school and the relationship you have with them, I feel genuinely greatful and happy for you, the fact that you were able to find such good friends. Not only that the card that they wrote made me realise out of all the people there at the party I should be one of the person that has the most to write to you, but when I saw the space that I have left available on the card and the time limit that constrainted me, I felt it was necessary to create this, to display what I truly want to express. 
          <br> 
          <br>
          I didn't want to read what the others wrote on the card, but I want to say that you have truly been a great friend through out the thousands of days that we've known for eachother for. You used to always say from time to time that you looked up to me, but I've always done the same. The way you think, the way you act and the relationship that you have with your family, is something that can't be asked for. Especially, when your dad made the announcement when we were cutting the cake, it really made me realise that your family really is a model family to be looked up to. When me and Carter was talking about your sisters, I really mean it when I say they are some of the best sisters, I hope you really appreciate them. Although as absurd as this may sound, but you made me the person I am today, you have truly been one of the main key turning points in my life. Regardless of how cheesy this whole letter may be, it is the truth. Theres so much more that I would like to say and express but, even with such format it would be too extensive to write everything down, I'll let time do its job and slowly unravel its secrets. Usually I am not the person to express myself, but i guess writing this letter is a way to express what I really want to say, but can't really say In-person. I hope our friendship will continue to last a lifetime and beyond.
