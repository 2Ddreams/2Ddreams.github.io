          ur thinking 
          the friends
           - genuinely greatful
          
          Chagned me deeply
          you've always said u looked up to me
           - but I've always done the same.
          
          the relationship that you have around u is something that one cant imagine to be asked for,  
          
          truly appreciated ,
          truly greatful
          
          made me the way I am today
          
          be friends with ur own siblings
          
          ur dad and ur mum.
           - 
          
          
          "kiss the rain"
           - 一语双关
          
          
          
          I've always thought of writing cards for a birthday in a way kind of superficial and not needed, but after experiencing, the great friends that u have gained within ur scholl and ur relationship with them, I feel genuinely greatful that you were able to have such good friends, not only that. The card that they wrote made me realise out of all the people there I should be one of the person that has the most to write to you on the card, and when I saw the space that I have left avaiblae on the card and the time limit that constrainted me, I felt it was neccsary to create this, to display what I truly want to express. I didn't read what the other wrote on the card, but
